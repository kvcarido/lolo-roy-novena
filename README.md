# Lolo Roy's Novena

A web-based digital program for the novena of my late grandfather, Edelmiro Verzosa. His 40th day death ceremony was held over Zoom to accomodate family from all over the country.

Rest in peace, Lolo. ðŸ•Š I'll miss you.

## Description
His novena took place on December 23, 2022. Since we had to have it over video conference, I wanted to honor my Lolo in a little digital corner of the internet in my own way.

This program was built using the simple things in life â€“Â vanilla HTML and CSS.

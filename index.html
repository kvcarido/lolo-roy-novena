                <h3>Introduction</h3>
    
                <p>In <a href="https://aboutphilippines.org/files/Pasiyam-and-40-Days.pdf" target="_blank">Filipino Catholicism</a>, the 9th and 40th days are significant after the death of a loved one. For 9 days after the death, the family recites prayers. In Filipino tradition, the name for this is “pasiyam” which means “that which is done for 9 days.”</p>
    
                <p>Where did these beliefs come from, especially considering how many Catholics don't believe in the 40th day tradition? Because the Spanish colonized the Philippines, there was a lot of mixing of beliefs and traditions. Today, most Filipino families follow Catholic funeral traditions.</p>
    
                <p>According to ancient beliefs, the deceased's soul stays on Earth for up to 9 days after the death. During this time, the family gathers for prayers and a celebratory meal in honor of the deceased.</p>
    
                <p>On the 40th day, a rosary is said. This is a way to protect the soul of the departed as they finalize their place in the afterlife. All of these traditions are a way to help with mourning the loss of a loved one and you'll see them displayed at some <a href="https://www.joincake.com/blog/filipino-funeral/" target="_blank">Filipino funerals</a>.</p>

On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.</p>
